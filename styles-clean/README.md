The styles I use in Firefox.

To install a style, simply copy the code of the desired style into a blank Stylish style. Note that Stylish version 1.4.1 breaks the 4chan style; view the comments in it for partial fixes.


#4chan
Requires [4chan X](http://phallus.github.io/4chan-x/) to work properly.

#Reddit
Runs on top of default Reddit. I'm not adding support for RES; don't ask unless you're willing to provide the code yourself.
